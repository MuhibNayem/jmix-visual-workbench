# Entity Designer Parity

Status date: 2026-07-30

This is the evidence and remaining-work contract for `STUDIO-CORE-001` and
`STUDIO-CORE-011`. It follows the official Jmix
[Entity Designer](https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/studio/entity-designer.html),
[entity model](https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/2.7/data-model/entities.html),
[enumeration model](https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/2.8/data-model/enumerations.html),
[datatype model](https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/data-model/datatype.html), and
[reverse-engineering workflow](https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/2.7/studio/reverse-engineering.html).

## Implemented in the current entity milestone

- JPA entity, mapped-superclass, embeddable, DTO and typed Jmix enumeration
  generation.
- UUID, Long, Integer, String and configured embedded identifier classes, with
  matching repository identifier types.
- Scalar metadata for String, Character, Boolean, Integer, Long, Double,
  BigDecimal, `java.util.Date`, Java time and offset time types,
  `java.sql.Date`, `java.sql.Time`, UUID, URI, byte array, `FileRef`, Jmix
  enums, embedded types and explicit custom Java/SQL datatypes.
- Correct Jmix `EnumClass<String|Integer>` generation. Persistent entity fields
  store the enum ID and expose null-safe enum accessors; they do not use JPA
  `@Enumerated`.
- Jmix DTO metadata through `@JmixEntity`, `@JmixId`, `@JmixProperty`,
  `@JmixGeneratedValue`, `@Store`, system-level metadata and optional
  read-only accessors without leaking JPA annotations into DTOs.
- Instance-name attributes and patterns; system-level, comment, LOB,
  property-datatype, dependent-property, annotated-properties-only and
  read-only metadata.
- Bean-validation annotations, parameters, escaped messages and validation
  groups.
- Relationships, compositions, collection type, ownership, cascade, orphan
  removal, join tables, delete policy and Jmix cross-data-store to-one
  references.
- Indexes, unique constraints, database views, DDL policy, protected unmapped
  schema objects, repositories and localized captions.
- Liquibase type alignment and remarks for the new scalar types, Jmix enum ID
  type and explicit custom SQL definitions.
- Existing Java source updates remain revision-bound, previewed and atomic.
  Additions and supported persistence-metadata changes preserve handwritten
  bodies and unmanaged annotations and are combined with rollback-capable
  Liquibase changes.
- New Java/Kotlin language selection is module-aware: entities, typed
  `EnumClass` declarations, repositories and repository activation source are
  generated directly into the matching production source set.
- Existing handwritten Kotlin entities now participate in additive round trip.
  The schema workspace reconstructs Kotlin IDs, columns, nullability, lengths,
  precision, scale, persistence and relationships; additions preserve manual
  bodies and imports, read current unsaved IntelliJ documents, reject stale
  indexed revisions, validate the resulting Kotlin PSI and share the atomic
  rollback-capable Liquibase plan. Existing Kotlin declaration/mapping changes
  fail closed until the project-wide impact refactor is implemented.
- The designer consumes the connected application graph and displays entity
  consumers across views, services, security, REST, workflow, menus and
  migrations.
- The native web surface has entity-kind-aware controls, a dedicated enum
  workspace, useful empty-state guidance and responsive pane switching.

## Claim boundary

This milestone materially expands the entity model and generator but does not
yet make `STUDIO-CORE-001` or `STUDIO-CORE-011` STRONG. Those claims remain
blocked until all of the following pass:

1. Complete impact-aware Java and Kotlin PSI refactoring for handwritten
   entities, including safe rename, type change and removal with project-wide
   usage refactoring. Additive Java/Kotlin round trip is implemented.
2. Partial live-database reverse engineering for selected tables, columns,
   keys and views, plus repeatable merge into existing source.
3. Attribute propagation into selected FlowUI views, fetch plans,
   localization bundles and security policies through one impact-reviewed
   atomic plan.
4. Composite-ID migration generation from a proven embeddable structure.
5. Populated PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, MSSQL and Oracle reverse-engineering
   and migration fixtures.
6. Installed-IDE interaction, undo, accessibility, large-project latency,
   memory and leak evidence.

No release or marketing claim may describe complete Studio Entity Designer
parity until those gates are closed.
